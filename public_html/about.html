                        <h3>Players & Equipment</h3>
                        <p>Each rugby team will consist of 15 players.
                            The team is split into two groups known as forwards and backs. 
                            There are 8 forwards (positions include: Hooker, Prop, Second Row, Flanker and Number Eight) and 7 backs (positions include: Scrum Half, Fly Half, Inside Centre, Outside Centre, Wingers and a Full Back).
                            The pitch is split up into three sections; one main playing area which must not exceed 100 metres and two dead goal areas which can range from 10 to 20 meters. 
                            The pitch must then be equal to 70 metres wide. 
                            The goal posts are in an <strong>‘H’</strong> shape and are roughly 5 to 6 meters apart with no restrictions on height.
                            The playes must wear Studded boots along with gum shields, head guards, shoulder pads and shin pads. 
                            Each team must wear the same coloured jerseys with matching shorts and socks.</p>

                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>Scoring</h3>
                        <p>Points can be scored in four ways:</P>
                        <ul>A <strong>try</strong> is awarded when a player places the ball down in their opponent’s dead ball area behind the goal. 5 points are awarded.</ul>
                        <ul>A <strong>conversion</strong> is a free kick that the team is awarded after a try to earn 2 bonus points. A successful kick needs to pass between the upper posts and top bar on the goal.</ul>
                        <ul>A <strong>penalty kick</strong> will gain a team 3 points and is awarded to a team when the opposing team causes an infringement.</ul>
                        <ul>A <strong>drop goal</strong> can be kicked out of the hand as long as the ball bounces first and can earn a team 3 points.</ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="w-100"></div>
                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>Object of the Game</h3>
                        <p>The Object of the game is to score more than your opponents in the 80 minute time frame.
                            Within a game the team with the ball must move up the field in <strong>phases of play</strong>.
                            The ball can not be passed forwards only backwards, but players can run forward with the ball or kick the ball forward to chase it down.
                            To win the game you must score more points than your opponent within 80 minutes. 
                        </p>
                        <ul>The game is broken down into two 40 minute halves with a 10 minute rest period in between. The game carries no stoppage time and will end exactly on 80 minutes.</ul>
                        <ul>Each team can start with 15 players and up to 7 substitutes. Players that have left the field are only allowed to return if they have been treated for an injury.</ul>

                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>Rules</h3>
                        <ul>The game must have one referee and two touch judges. It’s the referee’s job to time keep, make decisions throughout the game and keep order on the field. The two touch judges can assist the referee with decisions and also notify the referee when players are in touch (out of playing boundaries).</ul>
                        <ul>The game will stop if a player is fouled, the ball goes out of play or a try or drop goal is scored.</ul>
                        <ul>The defending team must tackle a player by grabbing a hold and pulling them to the floor. A tackle cannot be made above shoulder height and doing so will cause the referee to award a foul.</ul>
                        <ul>A successful conversion, penalty or kick at goal only occurs when the player manages to kick the ball through the top section of the goal. If a player is unsuccessful the ball is still in play until it crosses one of the playing fields boundaries.</ul>
