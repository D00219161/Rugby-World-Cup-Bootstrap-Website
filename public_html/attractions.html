          <h3>Don't Wing It</h3>
          <p>With a population of 127 million people, Japan has significant transport, hotel and hospitality infrastructure, however this also means things get busy and fill up. 
             The Japanese are great planners and plan ahead when they travel within their own country and you should too.
             When it comes to rules, the Japanese can be pretty rigid. 
             With such a large population, people need to follow the rules to make the society work. 
             This is one of the reasons Japan is one of the safest countries in the world. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
          <h3>Public Transport</h3>
          <p>Many Japanese people use their commute as a time to relax or sneak in a quick nap before they clock into the office for the day. 
             So, it goes without saying that commuters on trains and buses in Japan are expected to keep noise to a minimum, which includes talking on the phone. 
             If you have an urge to make a call or talk about to your friend next to you, try and keep your voice down where possible.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="w-100"></div>
    <div class="col">
        <h3>Eating On The Go!</h3>
        <p>With the exception of festivals and sporting matches, eating on the go is not encouraged in Japan and snacking on trains or in crowded spaces is frowned upon. 
           This is mostly to do with the potential for spillage onto another person and the propensity for this to create litter. 
           The general consensus around eating in public is that you should sit down, enjoy and respect your meal without focusing on getting from A to B.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
        <h3>Take Of Your Shoes & Bring a Gift</h3>
        <p>Japanese people associate the outside world with uncleanliness so don’t be surprised if you get asked to take your shoes off if you enter a friend’s home, a traditional Japanese restaurant or even some hotels.
           The Japanese love giving and receiving gifts.
           They don’t need to be fancy or expensive as its mainly the thought that counts.</p>

            It’s considered inappropriate to stab or cut food with your chopsticks, or to stick them upright in your food. 
            Putting your chopsticks upright in rice, for example, is associated with funeral traditions.</p>
